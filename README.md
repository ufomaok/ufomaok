- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Ufoma and
    I am currently working on data science-related projects in Python, such as machine learning fundamentals and data visualization.
    My Github pages maps out my data science journey, and I look forward to building more meaningful/complex projects as I strengthen my technical skills.
    My Github focuses on my own Python development as a developer. Here you will find projects targeting data science, statistical, and software engineering principles.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently utilizing: Python, Pandas, Numpy, sk-learn, Seaborn, and more!
- âœ¨ I am aiming to utilize my data science skills to solve real world problems. Thus, I am planning on pivoting into the technology field.
- âœ¨ Please feel free to reach out to me if you'd like to learn more about my projects or would like to connect!
